PHP mailer
==========

This is a simple PHP script to allow easy creation of arbitrary mail forms.

The variables defined at the top of `scripts/mailer.php` may be overridden to create a custom form.
The field `$formpage_name` must always be overridden to contain the name/URI of the form page.
See `example.php` for a usage example.
